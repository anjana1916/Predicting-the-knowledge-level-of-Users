# 📚 Predicting the Knowledge Level of Users

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict and classify a user's knowledge level based on factors such as study time, revision frequency, and exam performance. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze data collected from undergraduate students to determine their expertise in Electrical DC Machines.

## 📊 Methodology
- **Dataset**: User Knowledge Modelling Dataset from Gazi University (2009 semester)
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and outlier detection
- **Visualizations**: Histograms, scatter plots, pair plots, heatmaps
- **Models Used**:
  - 🟢 **Decision Tree Classifier** (Best performance with entropy criterion)
  - 🔵 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy comparison
  - Confusion matrix analysis

## 📈 Results
✅ **Decision Tree Classifier** outperformed KNN with an accuracy of **90%**.
✅ **KNN achieved 85%** accuracy.
✅ Strong correlation observed between **study time, revision frequency, and exam performance**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Scikit-Learn 🤖
- Pandas 🐼
- Matplotlib 📊
- Seaborn 🎨

## 🔬 Findings & Discussion
- Users with higher study time and revision frequency performed better in exams.
- Decision trees provided better interpretability for educators.
- Suggested improvements: Incorporating additional features like **mouse movements** and **keystrokes** for better predictions.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Exploring **ensemble models** to improve accuracy.
- Adding **more attributes** for better knowledge level classification.
- Implementing **real-time learning recommendations** based on predicted knowledge levels.
